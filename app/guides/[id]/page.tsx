          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Clutter is the enemy of a spotless home. When surfaces are covered with unnecessary items, even a clean home can look messy. Regular decluttering prevents accumulation and makes cleaning significantly easier.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            For every new item you bring into your home, remove one similar item. This simple rule prevents clutter from accumulating and forces you to consider whether new purchases are truly necessary.

Take advantage of this clean slate to establish good cleaning habits and create a healthy, welcoming environment for your new beginning.
